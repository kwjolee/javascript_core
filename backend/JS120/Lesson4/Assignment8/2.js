/*
the `goFast` method uses `this.constructor.name` to get the name of the type of vehicle
`this.constructor` points to the constructor that created the object
`smallCar` object was constructed by the `Car` function
these constructors have specific names
Car function's name is Car, Truck function's name is Truck
`Car` function was constructed by the `Function` function
so Car's constructor is Function, and Function's name is Function
