/*
this program uses the for loop
the variable num is declared and initialized with a value of 1
this for loop is then conditioned to run as long as `num` is less than or equal to 99
this loop also increments the value of `num` by 2 after every iteration
the starting number is an odd number, and the loop incremenets this number by 2 after every iteration, which has an effect of ensuring that
`number` is always reassigned to the next odd number
console.log outputs the number
